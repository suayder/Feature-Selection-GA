# Feature Selection Metaheuristics

This repo conteins some metaheuristics implementation for feature selection problem.

More precisally three algoriths:

- Simmulated Annealing
- Genetical Algorithm (not commited yet)
- Tabu Search

Each of then for parameters use DOE (Design of Experiments) for parameters selection, and the read data file code is implemented for read  Brast Cancer Data from Machine learning UI.

For compile code use `make` and for run `./a.out data_set_name`.
